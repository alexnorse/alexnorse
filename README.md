### Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

- Currently on the finish line of my educational process (specifically Architectures and Networking)
- Frameworks - UIKit and SwiftUI - I'm working in both!
- Preparing to launch my first App in AppStore this summer
- While you can see a few fully self-made projects right now on my page
- Opened to collaborations and trainee programs in iOS development
- Also opened (and even looking!) for the full-time Junior iOS engineer position
- Be happy and grateful to get constructive feedback on my current projects
