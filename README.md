### Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹
### A few words about myself ðŸ¦Š

- Currently on the finish line of my iOS educational process
- Frameworks - UIKit and SwiftUI - I'm working in both!
- Preparing to launch my first App in AppStore this summer
- While you can see a few completely self-made projects right now on my page
- Opened to collaborations and trainee programs in iOS development
- Also opened for the full-time Junior iOS engineer position
- Be happy and grateful to get constructive feedback on my current projects and new connections in the tech community!
